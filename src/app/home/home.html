          Creation of a website through WIX, this website had the aim of
          permitting Fossano's inhabitants to find every store in their city and
          the relative informations about them. This required me to call a part
          of these stores to ask for their permission to be on the site. From
          this experience i acquired better team work abilities and better
          interpersonal communication skills.
